# Overview

This project is a simple TypeScript program created to demonstrate core language features in a practical way. It showcases recursion, object-oriented programming with classes, working with lists (arrays), asynchronous functions using `async/await`, and robust error handling with `try/catch`.  

The program begins by printing a welcome message, calculates the factorial of a number recursively, introduces multiple `Person` objects stored in a list, simulates asynchronous data fetching, and finally demonstrates exception handling by attempting division by zero.  

It is designed as a learning exercise for developers familiar with JavaScript who want to explore TypeScript's type system and programming patterns in a clear, structured example.

# Development Environment

This project was developed and tested using the following setup:

- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (latest version recommended)
- **Language**: TypeScript (v5.x or later)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (v18.x or later)
- **Package Manager**: npm (bundled with Node.js)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub integration
- **Additional Tools**: ts-node (optional, for running TypeScript directly)

To get started:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and ensure `npm` is available.
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Install TypeScript globally:  
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript

# Future Work

- Refactor code into multiple modules with imports/exports for better organization
- Add unit tests to validate recursion, async functions, and exception handling
- Replace mock async function with real API calls to demonstrate practical usage
